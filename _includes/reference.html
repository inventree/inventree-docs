    <p class='admonition-title'>New in v0.8.0</p>
    <p>
        Reference patterns were introduced in version 0.8.0. Users upgrading from an older version may find that the reference fields behave slightly differently than previous versions.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    The {{ label }} <em>reference</em> field must conform to a (configurable) pattern, allowing users to define a standard for identifying individual orders.<br>
    In addition to being used ensure the reference fields conform to a standard format, the reference pattern is also used to automatically generate sequential reference values.
</p>
<p>
    The default pattern for the {{ label }} reference pattern is <code>{{ prefix }}{ref:04d}</code>.<br>
    This will generate a sequence of reference values like:
    
    <ul>
        <li>{{ prefix }}0001</li>
        <li>{{ prefix }}0002</li>
        <li>{{ prefix }}0003</li>
        <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    
    The {{ label }} reference pattern can be configured to generate a different reference sequence as required.
</p>
<p>
    The {{ label }} pattern is implemented as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>The pattern must specify a single <code>{ref}</code> block - this is the <em>required</em> sequential portion of the pattern.</li>
        <li>A <code>?</code> character is treated as a wildcard which will match any character.</li>
        <li>A <code>#</code> character is treated as a wildcard which will match any number.</li>
        <li>Any other characters will be matched literally.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
