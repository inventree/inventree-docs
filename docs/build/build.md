## Build Orders

A *Build Order* is used to create new stock by assembling component parts, according to a [Bill of Materials](./bom.md) (BOM).

A BOM can be specified for any [Part](../part/part.md) which is designated as an *Assembly*. The BOM consists of other Parts which are designated as *Components*.

A *Build Order* uses the BOM to allocate stock items to the assembly process. As the *Build Order* is completed, the required stock quantities are subtracted from allocated stock items.

### View Build Orders

To navigate to the Build Order display, select *Build* from the main navigation menu:

{% with id="build_display", url="build/build_display.png", description="Display Builds" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}

#### Table View

*Table View* provides a table of Build Orders, which can be filtered to only show the orders you are interested in.

{% with id="build_list", url="build/build_list.png", description="Build List" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}

#### Tree Vieww

*Tree View* also provides a tabulated view of Build Orders. Orders are displayed in a hierarchical manner, showing any parent / child relationships between different build orders. 

{% with id="build_tree", url="build/build_tree.png", description="Build Tree" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}

#### Calendar View

*Calendar View* shows a calendar display with upcoming build orders, based on the various dates specified for each build.

## Build Order Details

### Build Order Reference

Each Build Order is uniquely identified by its *Reference* field. Read more about [reference fields](../settings/reference.md).

### Build Parameters

The following parameters are available for each Build Order, and can be edited by the user:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Reference | Build Order reference e.g. '001' |
| Description | Description of the Build Order |
| Part | Link to the *Part* which will be created from the Build Order |
| Quantity | Number of stock items which will be created from this build |
| Sales Order | Link to a *Sales Order* to which the build outputs will be allocated |
| Source Location | Stock location to source stock items from (blank = all locations) |
| Destination Location | Stock location where the build outputs will be located |
| Target Date | Target date for build completion |
| Responsible | User (or group of users) who is resonsible for the build |
| External Link | Link to external webpage |
| Notes | Build notes, supports markdown |

### Build Output

A *Build Output* creates a new stock instance of the assembly part, of a specified quantity. Each *Build Order* requires at least one build output. Multiple build outputs can be specified if the build is completed in batches.

!!! info "Example - Build Outputs"
	For example, let's say we wish to create 10 new "Widgets". We create a new build for the widget, which signals an *intent* to assemble the "Widget" in quantity 10. We can produce 5 widgets in a single day, and so we create 2 build outputs, each of quantity 5.

### Build Status

Each *Build Order* has an associated *Status* flag, which indicates the state of the build:

| Status | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Pending` | Build has been created and build is ready for subpart allocation |
| `Production` | One or more build outputs have been created for this build |
| `Cancelled` | Build has been cancelled |
| `Completed` | Build has been completed |

### Stock Allocations

When a *Build Order* is created, we then have the ability to *allocate* stock items against that build order. The particular parts we need to allocate against the build are specified by the BOM for the part we are assembling.

- A *Stock Alloction* links a certain quantity of a given *Stock Item* to the build.
- At least one stock allocation is required for each line in the BOM
- Multiple stock allocations can be made against a BOM line if a particular stock item does not have sufficient quantity for the build

!!! info "Example - Stock Allocation"
	Let's say that to assembly a single "Widget", we require 2 "flanges". So, to complete a build of 10 "Widgets", 20 "flanges" will be required. We *allocate* 20 flanged against this build order.

Allocating stock to a build does not actually subtrack the stock from the database. Allocations signal an *intent* to take that stock for the purpose of this build. Stock allocations are actioned at the completion of a build.

!!! info "Part Allocation Information"
    Any part which has stock allocated to a build order will indicate this on the part information page.

For further information, refer to the [stock allocation documentation](./allocate.md).

## Build Order Display

The detail view for a single build order provides multiple display tabs, as follows:

### Build Details

The *Build Details* tab provides an overview of the Build Order:

{% with id="build_details", url="build/build_details.png", description="Details tab" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}

### Allocate Stock

The *Allocate Stock* tab provides an interface to allocate required stock (as specified by the BOM) to the build:

{% with id="build_allocate", url="build/build_allocate.png", description="Allocation tab" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}

The allocation table (as shown above) shows the stock allocation progress for this build. In the example above, there are two BOM lines, which have been partially allocated.

!!! info "Completed Builds"
	The *Allocate Stock* tab is not available if the build has been completed!

### Build Outputs

The *Build Outputs* tab shows the outputs (created stock items) associated with this build.

As shown below, there are separate panels for *incomplete* and *completed* build outputs.

{% with id="build_outputs", url="build/build_outputs.png", description="Outputs tab" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}

!!! info "Example: Build Outputs"
	In the example image above, a single output (serial number 2) has been completed, while serial numbers 1 and 4 are still in progress.

- Build outputs can be created from this screen, by selecting the *Create New Output* button
- Outputs which are "in progress" can be completed or cancelled
- Completed outputs (which are simply *stock items*) can be viewed in the stock table at the bottom of the screen

### Child Builds

If there exist any build orders which are *children* of the selected build order, they are displayed in the *Child Builds* tab:

{% with id="build_childs", url="build/build_childs.png", description="Child builds tab" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}

### Attachments

Files attachments can be uploaded against the build order, and displayed in the *Attachments* tab:

{% with id="build_attachments", url="build/build_attachments.png", description="Attachments tab" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}

### Notes

Build order notes (which support markdown formatting) are displayed in the *Notes* tab:

{% with id="build_notes", url="build/build_notes.png", description="Notes tab" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}

## Create Build Order

To create a build order for your part, you have two options:

### Part Detail Page

- Navigate to the detail page for the assembly part you wish to create
- Select the *Build Orders* tab
- Select *Start new Build*

{% with id="build_create_from_part", url="build/build_create_from_part.png", description="Create build from Part view" %}
{% include "img.html" %}
{% endwith %}

### Build Order Page

- Navigate to the Build Order overview page
- Click on *New Build Order*

Fill-out the form as required, then click the "Submit" button to create the build.

## Complete Build Order

To complete a build, click on <span class='fas fa-tools'></span> icon on the build detail page, the `Complete Build` form will be displayed.

The form will validate the build order is ready to be completed, and will prevent you from continuing if any of the below conditions are present unless you select one of the presented options to override the validation and accept completion of the build anyway.

!!! info "Incomplete Build"
	If the warning message `Required build quantity has not been completed` is shown, you have build ouputs that have not yet been completed.

	In the unlikely event that you wish to proceed despite this, you can toggle the `Accept Incomplete` option to true to override the error and allow completion without the required number of build outputs.

!!! info "Incomplete Allocation"
	If the warning message `Require stock has not been fully allocated` is shown, make sure to allocate stock matching all BOM items to the build before proceeding with build completion.

	If you wish to complete the build despite the missing parts, toggle the `Accept Unallocated` option to true to override the warning and allow completion with unallocated parts.

!!! info "Overallocated Stock Items"
	If the warning message `Some stock items have been overallocated` is shown, you have more stock than required by the BOM for the part being built allocated to the build order. By default the `Not permissted` option is selected and you will need to return to the allocation screen and remove the extra items before the build can be completed.

	Alternatively, you can select `Accept as consumed by this build order` to continue with the allocation and remove the extra items from stock (e.g. if they were destroyed during build), or select `Deallocate before completing this build order` if you would like the extra items to be returned to stock for use in future builds.


Select a `Location` to store the resulting parts from the build then click on the confirmation switch.
Finally, click on the "Complete Build" button to process the build completion.

!!! warning "Completed Build"
	**A completed build cannot be re-opened**. Make sure to use the confirm only if you are certain that the build is complete.

## Cancel Build Order

To cancel a build, click on <span class='fas fa-times-circle'></span> icon on the build detail page.

The `Cancel Build` form will be displayed, click on the confirmation switch then click on the "Cancel Build" button to process the build cancellation.

!!! warning "Cancelled Build"
	**A cancelled build cannot be re-opened**. Make sure to use the cancel option only if you are certain that the build won't be processed.

## Overdue Builds

Build orders may (optionally) have a target complete date specified. If this date is reached but the build order remains incomplete, then the build is considered *overdue*.

- Builds can be filtered by overdue status in the build list
- Overdue builds will be displayed on the home page
