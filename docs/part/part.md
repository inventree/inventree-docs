## Part

The *Part* is the core element of the InvenTree ecosystem. A Part object is the archetype of any stock item in your inventory. Parts are arranged in heirarchical categories which are used to organise and filter parts by function.

## Part Category 

Part categories are very flexible and can be easily arranged to match a particular user requirement. Each part category displays a list of all parts *under* that given category. This means that any part belonging to a particular category, or belonging to a sub-category, will be displayed.

Each part category also shows a list of sub-categories which exist underneath it.

{% with id="part_category", url="part/part_category.png", description="Parts are arranged in categories" %}
{% include 'img.html' %}
{% endwith %}

The category part list provides an overview of each part:

* Part name and description
* Part image thumbnail
* Part category
* Part stock level

The list of parts underneath a given category can be filtered by multiple user-configurable filters, which is especially useful when a large number of parts exist under a certain category.

Clicking on the part name links to the [*Part Detail*](./views.md) view.

## Part Options

Each *Part* defined in the database provides a number of different options which determine how that part can be used. Configuring these options for a given part will impact the available functions that can be perform on (or using) that part).

### Virtual

A *Virtual* part is one which does not physically exist but should still be tracked in the system. This could be a process step, machine time, software license, etc.

### Template

A *Template* part is one which can have *variants* which exist underneath it. [Read further information about template parts here](./template.md).

### Assembly

If a part is designated as an *Assembly* it can be created (or built) from other component parts. As an example, a circuit board assembly is made using multiple electronic components, which are tracked in the system. An *Assembly* Part has a Bill of Materials (BOM) which lists all the required sub-components. [Read further information about BOM management here](../build/bom.md).

### Component

If a part is designated as a *Component* it can be used as a sub-component of an *Assembly*. [Read further information about BOM management here](../build/bom.md)

### Trackable

Trackable parts can be assigned batch numbers or serial numbers which uniquely identify a particular stock item. Trackable parts also provide other features (and restrictions) in the InvenTree ecosystem.

[Read further information about trackable parts here](./trackable.md).

### Purchaseable

If a part is designated as *Purchaseable* it can be purchased from external suppliers. Setting this flag allows parts to be added to [purchase orders](../companies/po.md).

### Salable

If a part is designated as *Salable* it can be sold to external customers. Setting this flag allows parts to be added to sales orders.

### Active

By default, all parts are *Active*. Marking a part as inactive means it is not available for many actions, but the part remains in the database. If a part becomes obsolete, it is recommended that it is marked as inactive, rather than deleting it from the database.

## Part Import

*Parts* can be imported by staff-members on the part-list-view (this feature must be enabled in the part-settings), in the part-settings or on the [admin-page for parts](../settings/import.md) (only accessible if you are also an admin). The first two options provide a multi-stage wizard that enables mapping fields from various spreadsheet or table-data formats while the latter requires a well-formatted file but is much more performant.
