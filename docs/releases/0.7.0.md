## Release: 0.7.0

0.7.0 is a major feature release of the InvenTree software project. For a comprehsive list of changes associated with this release, please refer to the [InvenTree GitHub page](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/milestone/10).

## New Features

### Order Target Dates

[#2684](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/2684) adds a `target_date` field to both the PurchaseOrderLineItem and SalesOrderLineItem models, separate to the `target_date` field on the parent _Order_ models. This allows expected shipment dates to be specified for individual line items.

### It's a Date!

[#2685](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/2685) adds the ability for users to customize how dates are formatted and displayed in the web interface.

### Serialize Incoming Stock

[#2686](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/2686) provides the ability to add batch codes and serial numbers to incoming stock items received against purchase orders.

### Persistent Forms

[#2687](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/2687) adds the ability for modal forms to be "persistent" - i.e. they are not immediately dismissed after successful submission. This allows (for example) the "Create Part" form to be used multiple times in succession, allowing quick creation of parts by the user.

### Stock Scheduling

[#2695](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/2695) adds a new "Scheduling" tab to the "Part" display. This displays projected / predicted future stock levels, based on pending orders.

### Automatic Stock Allocation

[#2713](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/2713) adds a feature to "automatically" allocate stock items to a build order.

### Notifications

[#2372](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/2372) provides an overhaul of notifications, allowing users to view their notifications directly in the InvenTree interface.

### Why are you hiding my name?
[#2861](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/2861) adds several changes to enable admins to remove more of InvenTrees branding. Change logo, hide the about-modal for all but superusers and add custom messages to login and main navbar. Check out [the docs](../start/config.md#customisation-options).

### Label Printing Plugin

[#2768](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/2768) adds a new LabelPrinting plugin class, which allows printing labels directly to external printers (e.g. via local network).

### New Search Menu

[#2783](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/pull/2783) introduces a new quick search menu which provides more comprehensive search results for quicker data access.
