## Stock Ownership

InvenTree supports stock ownership, which allows to set groups and users as "owners" of stock locations and items. The owners would be the only users who can edit and manage those stock locations and items.

The stock ownership feature is disabled by default, and must be enabled via the settings menu:

{% with id="stock_owner", url="stock/enable_stock_owner.png", description="Enable stock ownership feature" %}
{% include 'img.html' %}
{% endwith %}

!!! warning "Existing Stock Locations and Items"
	Enabling the ownership feature will automatically remove the edit permissions to all users for stock locations and items which **do not have** any owner set. Only a user with admin permissions will be able to set the owner for those locations and items.

### Owner: Group vs User

There are two types of owners in InvenTree: [groups](../settings/permissions.md#group) and [users](../settings/permissions.md#user).

* If a group is selected as owner, **all** users linked to the specified group will be able to edit the stock location or item.
* If a user is selected as owner, only the specified user will be able to edit the stock location or item.

When selecting an owner, in the drop-down list, groups are annotated with the `(group)` tag and users are annotated with the `(user)` tag:

{% with id="stock_owner_type", url="stock/stock_owner_type.png", description="Display stock owner type" %}
{% include 'img.html' %}
{% endwith %}

### Set Stock Location Owner

To specify the owner of a stock location, navigate to the stock location detail page. Click on the <span class='fas fa-sitemap'></span> icon under the location's name then click on "Edit Location".

!!! warning
	If you cannot see the <span class='fas fa-sitemap'></span> icon, it means that you do **not** have permissions to edit stock locations. Refer to [the permissions documentation/../settings/permissions.md#roles) and/or contact your InvenTree administrator.

In the "Edit Stock Location" form, select the owner and click the "Submit" button:

{% with id="stock_location_owner", url="stock/stock_location_owner.png", description="Set stock location owner" %}
{% include 'img.html' %}
{% endwith %}

Setting the owner of stock location will automatically:

* Set the owner of all children locations to the same owner.
* Set the owner of all stock items at this location to the same owner.

!!! info
	If the owner of a children location or a stock item is a subset of the specified owner (eg. a user linked to the specified group), the owner won't be updated.

### Set Stock Item Owner

To specify the owner of a stock item, navigate to the stock item detail page. Click on the <span class='fas fa-tools'></span> icon under the item's name then click on "Edit stock item".

!!! warning
	If you cannot see the <span class='fas fa-tools'></span> icon, it means that you do **not** have permissions to edit stock items. Refer to [the permissions documentation](../../settings/permissions/#roles) and/or contact your InvenTree administrator.

In the "Edit Stock Item" form, select the owner and click the "Save" button:

{% with id="stock_item_owner", url="stock/stock_item_owner.png", description="Set stock item owner" %}
{% include 'img.html' %}
{% endwith %}
