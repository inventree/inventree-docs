## Stock Tracking

Stock items may be *tracked* using:

- Batch Codes
- Serial Numbers

### Batch Codes

Batch codes can be used to specify a particular "group" of items, and can be assigned to any stock item without restriction. Batch codes are tracked even as stock items are split into separate items.
