## EventMixin

The `EventMixin` class enables plugins to respond to certain triggered events.

When a certain (server-side) event occurs, the background worker passes the event information to any plugins which inherit from the `EventMixin` base class.

Implementing classes must provide a `process_event` function:

```python
class EventPlugin(EventMixin, IntegrationPluginBase):
    """
    A simple example plugin which responds to events on the InvenTree server.
    
    This example simply prints out the event information. 
    A more complex plugin could respond to specific events however it wanted.
    """    

    PLUGIN_NAME = "EventPlugin"
    PLUGIN_SLUG = "event"
    PLUGIN_TITLE = "Triggered Events"

    def process_event(self, event, *args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Processing triggered event: '{event}'")
```

### Events

Events are passed through using a string identifier, e.g. 'build.completed'

The arguments (and keyword arguments) passed to the receiving function depend entirely on the type of event.

Implementing a response to a particular event requires a working knowledge of the InvenTree code base, especially related to that event being received.
