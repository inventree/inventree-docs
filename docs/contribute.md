InvenTree is an open source project, and benefits greatly from user contributions.

If you find InvenTree to be useful, and wish to improve the software, please consider contributing:

### Source Code

InvenTree is built using [Python3](https://www.python.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/inventree/inventree).

Contributions towards the core InvenTree code base are welcomed; either extending current functionality, prodiving new features, or addressing outstanding issues.

### Report Bugs

If you find a bug or a feature that does not work correctly, please report it on [GitHub](https://github.com/inventree/inventree/issues). Reporting bugs is critical to improving the software. If you are able and willing, providing a fix for any outstanding issues would be greatly appreciated.

### Translation

InvenTree provides a translation layer for both the web interface and mobile app. Native language translation requires effort from translators to provide multi-lingual support. If you wish to translate InvenTree to a new language (or improve an existing translation), such contributions would be greatly appreciated!.

Native language translation of the InvenTree web application is [community contributed via crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/inventree).

_**Contributions are welcomed and encouraged!**._

To contribute to the translation effort, navigate to the [InvenTree crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/inventree), create a free account, and start making translations suggestions for your language of choice!
